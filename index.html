                        <p>Origami is the craft (or art) of folding paper into shapes and sculptures. The word derives
                            from the Japanese word 'oru' which means "to fold", and 'kami' which means "paper".
                            Mathematics need to be made more visual for some learners and here are some advantages of
                            using origami in the Mathematics classroom.</p>

                        <h4 class="my-lg-4 my-sm-3 mt-3 mb-2">Original</h4>
                        <p>Paper was first invented in China around 105 A.D., and was brought to Japan by monks in the
                            sixth century. Handmade paper was a luxury item only available to a few, and paper folding
                            in ancient Japan was strictly for ceremonial purposes, often religious in nature. </p>

                        <p>Many origami books begin with a description of basic origami techniques which are used to
                            construct the models. This includes simple diagrams of basic folds like valley and mountain
                            folds, pleats, reverse folds, squash folds, and sinks. There are also standard named bases
                            which are used in a wide variety of models, for instance the bird base is an intermediate
                            stage in the construction of the flapping bird. Additional bases are the preliminary base
                            (square base), fish base, waterbomb base, and the frog base.</p>

                        <p>Traditionally, it was believed that if one folded 1000 origami cranes, one's wish would come
                            true. It has also become a symbol of hope and healing during challenging times. As a result,
                            it has become popular to fold 1000 cranes (in Japanese, called “senbazuru”).</p>

                        <h4 class="my-lg-4 my-sm-3 mt-3 mb-2">The importance of origami</h4>
                        <p>Modern origami has attracted a worldwide following, with ever more intricate designs and new
                            techniques. One of these techniques is 'wet-folding,' the practice of dampening the paper
                            somewhat during folding to allow the finished product to hold shape better. Variations such
                            as modular origami, also known as unit origami, is a process where many origami units are
                            assembled to form an often decorative whole.

                            Complex origami models normally require thin, strong paper or tissue foil for successful
                            folding; these lightweight materials allow for more layers before the model becomes
                            impractically thick. Modern origami has broken free from the traditional linear construction
                            techniques of the past, and models are now frequently wet-folded or constructed from
                            materials other than paper and foil. With popularity, a new generation of origami creators
                            has experimented with crinkling techniques and smooth-flowing designs used in creating
                            realistic masks, animals, and other traditional artistic themes.</p>

                        <p>Origami is a very popular craft today. It helped inspire the book Sadako and the Thousand
                            Paper Cranes, which was later turned into a movie. The art form has even inspired the design
                            of things like airbags and heart stents. Origami sculptures can be fascinating.</p>

                        In the early days we exchanged passionately about experiences, techniques in paper folding,
                        introducing each other to new compositions, though still in its infancy. So far, we have
                        participated in organizing many exhibitions, introductory workshops, teaching Origami at
                        schools, centers, culture houses and cultural exchange events in big and small cities
                        nationwide. The talented members also gradually confirmed their names, introduced-invited to
                        attend international exhibitions, through Origami to introduce Vietnamese people to their
                        friends across five continents ... <br>

                        In Origami contains a lot of profound living philosophy, a magical worldview that is all formed
                        by paper, brains, hands and burning passion. And above all, <b>origaME art</b> is also the place
                        where we have extended our big arms to connect with friends from all over the sky, not only in
                        Vietnam but also in the world. We, Vietnam Origami Group hope to contribute a small part of our
                        efforts to the historical flow of modern origami.

                                            They first chanted slogans and sang a song that has become their anthem,
                                            backed by a small group playing on woodwind and brass instruments through

                                            Many lined the balustrades of the three higher floors overlooking where
                                            others gathered in the wide space below.

                                            Transit authorities closed the two stations on the airport express train to
                                            guard against a possible disruption to the transportation hub.

                                            The Hong Kong International Airport Authority said that the train would

                                        <p class="my-3">Nestlé Japan has announced it is launching recyclable paper
                                            packaging for its KitKat products in a bid to tackle plastic waste.

                                            Japan is the biggest market for KitKats and, according to reports, around 4m
                                            KitKat Minis are sold across the country every day.


                                            While they might be miniature in size, the impact of millions of plastic
                                            wrappers accumulating in landfill has been enough to persuade Nestlé to
                                            reconsider the way it packages its most popular product.

                                            As a result, the confectionery company is discontinuing the use of plastic
                                            packaging and replacing it with a paper version that is both environmentally
                                            friendly and fun.

                                            You see, the new wrappers aren’t made from any old paper.

                                            Ways to reduce your single-use plastic

                                            Plastic water bottle for a reusable beverage container
                                            Coffee cup for a Travel coffee mug
                                            Plastic bags for reusable cloth bags
                                            Coffee pods for a pot of coffee
                                            The updated versions will also come with instructions on how to make an
                                            origami paper crane to encourage customers to use their packaging to get
                                            creative instead of just throwing it away.

                                            As well as being creative and possibly kick-starting a new hobby, Nestlé has
                                            estimated that the new initiative will help to reduce the brand’s plastic
                                            waste by approximately 380 tonnes per year.

                                            The first phase in this new packaging roll-out will cover the KitKat Mini’s
                                            five top-selling flavours, including the original, matcha, and otona no
                                            amasa (meaning adult-level sweetness or less sweet).

                                            The initiative is part of the company’s commitment to only use 100 per cent
                                            recyclable and reusable packaging by 2025.

                                            Earlier this year, Nestlé launched a new snack bar that is sold in
                                            completely recyclable packaging which degrades in a marine environment
                                            within six months.

                                            Similarly, the brand also unveiled its first chocolate bar made without any
                                            refined sugar last month..</p>

                                                US have developed an artificial muscle that can lift up to a thousand
                                                times its own weight.

                                                Report suggest the muscles could be used to provide extraordinary
                                                strength to robots, yet allowing them to operate with precision and
                                                dexterity.

                                                Artificial muscles are flexible actuators with capabilities similar to,
                                                or even beyond, natural muscles. They have been widely used in many
                                                applications as alternatives to more traditional rigid electromagnetic
                                                motors,” the scientists write in the Proceedings of the National Academy
                                                of Sciences.

                                                Daniela Rus, director of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial
                                                Intelligence Laboratory and one of the study’s senior authors, said
                                                scientists had been interested in soft robots for some time - they’re
                                                robust and easy control.



                                                The drawback is that unlike robots made from hard materials, they have
                                                little ability to lift

                                                “What we want are soft, safe, compliant robots that have strength, that
                                                have the properties that are now achievable with hard-bodied systems,”
                                                she said. “This way we have the best of both worlds.”

                                            <hr>
                                            According to the National Center for Education Statistics in 2003, geometry
                                            was one area of weakness among American students. Origami has been found to
                                            strengthen an understanding of geometric concepts, formulas, and labels,
                                            making them come alive. Here’s how to use it in your class (PDF). By
                                            labeling an origami structure with length, width, and height, students will
                                            learn key terms and ways to describe a shape. You can use origami to
                                            determine the area by applying a formula to a real-world structure.

                                            Origami excites other modalities of learning. It has been shown to improve
                                            spatial visualization skills using hands-on learning. Such skills allow
                                            children to comprehend, characterize, and construct their own vernacular for
                                            the world around them. In your class, find origami or geometric shapes in
                                            nature and then describe them with geometric terms.

                                            The concept of fractions is scary to lots of students. Folding paper can
                                            demonstrate the fractions in a tactile way. In your class, you can use
                                            origami to illustrate the concepts of one-half, one-third, or one-fourth by
                                            folding paper and asking how many folds students would need to make a
                                            certain shape. The act of folding the paper in half and in half again and so
                                            on can also be used to demonstrate the concept of infinity.

                                            Often in assignments, there is one set answer and one way to get there.
                                            Origami provides children an opportunity to solve something that isn't
                                            prescribed and gives them a chance to make friends with failure (i.e. trial
                                            and error). In your class, show a shape and ask students to come up with a
                                            way to make it. They may get the solution from various approaches. Remember,
                                            there is no wrong answer.

                                            Fun Science
                                            <hr>
                                            Origami is a fun way to explain physics concepts. A thin piece of paper is
                                            not very strong, but if you fold it like an accordion it will be. (Look at
                                            the side of a cardboard box for proof.) Bridges are based on this concept.
                                            Also, origami is a fun way to explain molecules. Many molecules have the
                                            shape of tetrahedrons and other polyhedra.

                                            I hope that I don't need to explain fun. Here are some activities (with
                                            diagrams) to keep those young hands and minds working.

                                            No Papering Over Origami's Benefits
                                            Children love origami as evidenced by how they are enamored with their first
                                            paper airplane, paper hat, or paper boat. And while we might not always
                                            think about it, origami surrounds us -- from envelopes, paper fans, and
                                            shirt folds to brochures and fancy towels. Origami envelops us (forgive the
                                            pun). Origami has been found to improve not only 3D perception and logical
                                            thinking (PDF), but also focus and concentration.

                                            Researchers have found that students who use origami in math perform better.
                                            In some ways, it is an untapped resource for supplementing math instruction
                                            and can be used for geometric construction, determining geometric and
                                            algebraic formulas, and increasing manual dexterity along the way. In
                                            addition to math, origami is a great way to merge science, technology,
                                            engineering, art, and math all together: STEAM.

                                            Origami is a STEAM Engine
                                            While schools are still catching up to the idea of origami as a STEAM engine
                                            (the merging of these disciplines), origami is already being used to solve
                                            tough problems in technology. Artists have teamed up with engineers to find
                                            the right folds for an airbag to be stored in a small space, so that it can
                                            be deployed in a fraction of a second. Additionally, the National Science
                                            Foundation, one of the government's largest funding agencies, has supported
                                            a few programs that link engineers with artists to use origami in designs.
                                            The ideas range from medical forceps to foldable plastic solar panels.

                                            And origami continues to amaze scientists with its presence in nature. Many
                                            beetles have wings that are bigger than their bodies. In fact they can be as
                                            much as two or three times as large. How are they able to do that? Their
                                            wings unfold in origami patterns. Insects are not alone. Leaf buds are
                                            folded in intricate ways that resemble origami art, too. Origami is all
                                            around us and can be a source of inspiration for children and adults alike.

                                            So no matter how you fold it, origami is a way to get children engaged in
                                            math, could improve their skills, and makes them appreciate the world around
                                            them more. When it comes to making lessons exciting, origami is above the
                                            fold.

                                        <p class="my-3">Robert Lang ditched a career as a physicist to pursue origami
                                            full time. In WIRED's latest video, he reveals the tricks to folding complex
                                            shapes.

                                            BEFORE BECOMING A physicist, before being the editor in chief of the Journal
                                            of Quantum Electronics, before helping NASA design its largest space
                                            telescope, Robert Lang learned to fold paper.

                                            Already a numbers whiz at age six, Lang had trouble sitting still during
                                            math class. His teacher gave him an origami book to keep him occupied and
                                            Lang started to fold. He never stopped. He folded his way through high
                                            school and his undergraduate years at Caltech, decorating his shelves with a
                                            parade of tiny paper ants. He kept folding throughout his graduate work in
                                            applied physics, when in 1987, he made an actual-size cuckoo clock after a
                                            trip to Germany’s Black Forest.

                                            Eventually in 2001, Lang quit his science day jobs and committed to origami
                                            full time. The ancient art still requires artists to fashion their creations
                                            out of a single, square piece of paper, without tearing or gluing pieces
                                            together. But now, artists use mathematics to map out their incredibly
                                            detailed and lifelike paper creations. Lang has built musicians strumming
                                            guitars, a hummingbird drinking from a flower, a fish with 400 scales, and a
                                            female praying mantis devouring her mate.

                                            Lang’s work has been showcased in museums across the country, but his
                                            facility with folding doesn’t only yield beautiful sculptures. He’s helped
                                            design stents that collapse, so they’re easier to thread through arteries,
                                            and created computer programs that use origami to model how an airbag should
                                            be packed away in the dashboard. And he worked with NASA to create a
                                            telescope that folds up during launch and then unfurls once in space.

                                            “There are many ways to define complexity for origami,” says Lang in WIRED’s
                                            latest video. You could count the number of folds needed to finish a design,
                                            or tally the more advanced moves needed to create a certain shape. Lang uses
                                            a combination of these two metrics as he fashions and refashions a cicada, a
                                            classic origami shape. To the untrained eye, the first design looks vaguely
                                            bug-like: two wings poke out from behind a square head. Soon the creature
                                            gains eyes and antennae. Lang’s fingers carefully crease and manipulate the
                                            paper, following a series of intricate steps whose purpose isn’t immediately
                                            clear. Then, almost out of nowhere, six delicate legs appear. A segmented
                                            carapace emerges. Suddenly he’s holding a lifelike insect, ready to take
                                            flight.

                                        <p class="my-3">Saturday Night Live bit from last year when "Steve Bannon"
                                            (someone in a Skeletor-faced Death costume) sent "President Trump" (Alec
                                            Baldwin) to a smaller kids’ desk in the Oval Office? the name may not have
                                            been on the tip of your tongue then, but the toy that Trump/Baldwin begins
                                            to play with is called a Hoberman Sphere—and its creator has made scores of
                                            other contraptions just as mathematically complex.

                                            Like what? Well, for one Chuck Hoberman also worked on a 4,000-square-foot
                                            expanding video screen for U2’s 360° Tour and consulted on the iris-like
                                            opening of the roof at Mercedez-Benz Stadium. But after years of making
                                            geometrically-complex objects using joints and hinges, the
                                            artist-turned-engineer is pivoting to a different form of inspiration:
                                            origami.

                                            "Up until about 20 years ago, origami was a craft and an art," Hoberman says
                                            the latest episode of WIRED’s Obsessed. "Now it’s a topic of math,
                                            engineering, robotics, structures. It’s being studied in all of its full
                                            glory."

                                            To find out what he can do with large-scale origami, Hoberman cuts various
                                            pieces out of plastic and assembles them to see if they work together to
                                            make viable structures. Mathematics, he says, has shows "a flat sheet can be
                                            folded into any shape at all," and those shapes could be very beneficial to
                                            engineers.

                                            The thing that ties Hoberman’s well-known sphere to his new work is what he
                                            calls "transformative design." "Most designed objects are static through
                                            their lifetime and eventually disposed of," he says. "I'm looking for a
                                            different angle on it, which is: What if those objects were dynamic and
                                            alive and in movement around us?" In other words, his career has come
                                            full-circle.
